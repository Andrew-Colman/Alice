# Alice
Bot is being rewritten to use Discord.js v12 features.

A multipurpose Discord bot mainly made for osu!droid and Malody.

Optimized for [osu!droid International Discord server](https://discord.gg/nyD92cE) usage.

Based on [Elaina](https://github.com/NeroYuki/Elaina) by [NeroYuki](https://github.com/NeroYuki) with a few additions and changes.

osu!droid: http://ops.dgsrz.com/

Note: Even though this code is open-source, some codes are personalized (made for a specific server only) and you still need more things to run the bot, therefore it is not available publicly.
